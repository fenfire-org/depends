gnoclient.jar is in the gnowsis/lib/ directory of
    http://www.gnowsis.org/statisch/download/gnowsis_0.8.1.zip

I made remotebrowser.jar myself by zipping up a couple of classes
which are also distributed in the download above. The org.gnowsis...
classes are in gnowsis/classes/org/gnowsis/..., and the
de.dfki... class is in the JAR file
gnowsis/import/epos_shared/dfki_common/DFKIUtils2.jar.
(The source for that class is also in the JAR file, if you were looking.)
